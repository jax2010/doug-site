            Gadget: Extra Mustard - Doubles your next main attack damage. Lots of use cases, and it doubles super charge rate as well. <br>
            Gadget: Double Sausage - Doubles your next main attack healing. Used mostly for Bodyguard Doug, where you bunch around your teammates and heal <br>
            Starpower: Self Service- Main attack heals Doug by 480. Mostly outshines the other one, gives Doug the healing that he needs. <br>
            Starpower: Fast Food - Resurected targets have increased movement speed for 3 seconds. This one I don't get the best value out of, and after a few games with it I scrapped using it all together <br>
        </p>
        <img src = "IMAGES/Vision Speed.jpg" class = "gear-pics" alt = "secondbest ahh build">
        <p class = "main-paragraph">Secondbest build -- also the one I use the most currently. 
            I personally wouldn't recommend it, it's mostly for trolling. 
            However, speed is really useful for Doug because he needs the speed in order to catch up to opponents, 
            and he's usually in bushes anyways since he needs to sneak up on opponents.
            I use this everywhere.
        </p>
        <img src = "IMAGES/Speed Reload.jpg" class = "gear-pics" alt = "speed reload">
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            I used to use this build a lot, mostly because its very useful.
            His double damage gadget absolutely carries Doug because it helps him take care of enemies with higher than 7200 health, and it doubles his super charge rate.
            Speed I've already mentioned before, but it is really useful for Doug because he can sneak up on opponents.
            I use this against less high DPS brawlers (in ranked), and more tanky brawlers.
        </p>
        <img src = "IMAGES/Speed Damage.jpg" class = "gear-pics" alt = "speed damage">
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            Damage is always useful for tanks (but overrated for anything else). It also affects his healing, so there is even more value in it.
            Speed is useful because Doug is a slow boy and he uses bushes a lot to sneak up on opponents.
            I use this in bushy maps like snake pirarie, against more squishy brawlers (which aren't often picked in bush maps).
        </p>
        <img src = "IMAGES/Damage Reload.jpg" class = "gear-pics" alt = "damage reload">
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            Damage has a lot of value for Doug -- mentioned before.
            Reload also has a lot of value -- mentioned before.
            I use this in more open maps without a lot of bushes/walls.
