            You play like a Mortis/Kenji. Go in, die, repeat. This helps charge your super, kill enemies, and create space for your teammates. 
            It's mostly like a downgraded Jacky playstyle (which is why I personally don't like it).

        <h3 class = "sub-subtitles">How to Play:</h3>
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            You play like a downgraded Jacky. <br>
            An important combo you want to know (especially against squishy brawlers) is the gadget attack + regular attack. It deals 7200 damage in a very short amount of time. <br>
            A key niche that is really good for Doug's aggressive playstyle is to rush when the enemies are bunched up. 
            This allows him to charge his super fast. <br>
            All bush maps, like Snake Pirarie, helps a lot with Doug. Especially since the map is tank heavy, you can bunch up with your teammates and rush the enemy.
            Doug's healing helps with his teammates stay alive, and being bunched up allows him to heal both at once. <br>
            To summarize, its really just a downgraded Jacky playstyle. Except you don't have a speed up gadget, or a super that allows you to pull in enemies.
        </p>
        <h2 class = "subtitles">2. Alternating/Bodyguard</h2>
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            This type of playstyle mostly focuses on balanced/open maps.
        </p>
        <h3 class = sub-subtitles>Overview</h3>
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            You play more like a support during this playstyle. <br>
            Doug is not the best healer in the game, in fact he gets absolutely outclassed in almost every category by healers and other utility brawlers. <br>
            However, Doug has the highest burst healing in the game (other than Poco super). This makes him a substantial healer in the game, and you can use him in 
            open bounty maps, where all you do is crowd around your snipers and top them off once they get hit. <br>
            Alternating = healing and attacking <br>
            Bodyguard = healing (use double healing gadget) -- u/AidAin21 is best bodyguard Doug (I think)

        <h3 class = "sub-subtitles">How to Play:</h3>
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            This way of playing focuses on the support aspect of Doug. <br>
            You bunch around your teammates and constantly heal as soon as they get low. You have the highest burst healing (3600, 4800 w Gadget), so you can easily top off
            your teammates. You can unexpectedly aggro, and this helps punish overextensions. You also have a high damage output against squishier assassins, especially
            those that need to get into close range (Mortis, Mico), so you can defend against those as well. 
        </p>
        <h3 class = "sub-subtitles">Examples:</h3>
        <img src = "../IMAGES/dueling beetles match.png" class = "gear-pics" alt = "example match">
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            In this scenario, you've been healing up your teammates and holding zone time. But the middle red guy overextends. <br>
            You will most likely die when you try to punish the overextension. But its better to turn the 3v3 into a 2v2 when your teammates have better positioning. <br>
            In this case, it even has the additional effect of funneling in close range enemies, or making long range enemies waste ammo and time to kill you. 
        </p>
        <h2 class = "subtitles">3. Pressure</h2>
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            This type of playstyle mostly focuses on open maps. (its also my personal favorite)
        </p>
        <h3 class = "sub-subtitles">Overview</h3>
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            Playing Doug like this is a lot like playing Sam. It's all about dodging and baiting shots, 
            while creating space for your team. Its just not as aggro as Sam because Doug is qualified as a “support.” 
            <br>
            <br>
            When used correctly, Doug can counter slow reload snipers (ie. Piper, Angelo). 
            HOWEVER one exception is Belle her slow gadget + her mark makes it hard for Doug to stick beside his teammates and constantly heal, or move up without getting damage diffed.

        <h3 class = "sub-subtitles">How to Play:</h3>
        <p class = "main-paragraph">
            You want to run around the map and double down lanes when applying pressure. Dont be TOO afraid to overextend, 
            so long as you have the health to run back to your teammates. 
            Doubling lanes means you can heal your teammates (and takes advantage of slow reload on the enemys part). <br>
            <br>
            Stick to your walls. They are home, they are safety, they are the parents you never had. 
            Milk them for what they are worth. Bait shots from behind, heal your teammates, create space, and 
            slowly force enemies back by taking advantage of key opportunities (namely an enemy dying. This allows you to move up to your next safe spot). <br>
            <br>
            NEVER go mid lane. You have enough health to be able to take on one brawler. It even allows you to overextend a little bit without much punishment. 
            Mid lane destroys all this. You can get pinched, and definitely killed when you overextend, because instead of a solo job, your getting gangbanged. (double damage)
